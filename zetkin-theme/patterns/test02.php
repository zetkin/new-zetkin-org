<p>So, our task is not only to unleash the revolution but also to prepare the conditions for its victory. This issue was considered in the leading article in&nbsp;<strong>Iskra</strong>&nbsp;n.&nbsp;87. So we can even go further and say: no need to unleash the revolution because it is already unleashed and the goal is just to prepare its victory. But how? By adding the elements of the political and technical organization to the unleashed revolutionary situation. In short it means to organize a revolution. So that issue was considered in the article by Comrade Parvus named&nbsp;<em>Results and Prospects</em>. At first the Editorial office considered it as a pure misunderstanding but later accepted it and now this article became highly cited.</p>
